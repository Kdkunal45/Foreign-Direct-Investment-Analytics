## Overview

Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in the economic development of nations by facilitating capital flows, technology transfer, and job creation. The Foreign Direct Investment Analytics project aims to analyze historical FDI data, identify trends, compare FDI flows between countries, sectors, and regions, and assess the impact of FDI on economic indicators.

## Features

- Data collection from reliable sources such as World Bank, UNCTAD, and national statistics agencies.
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution, correlations, and dynamics of FDI data.
- Visualization of insights using time series plots, choropleth maps, bar charts, and other visualizations.
- Modeling techniques such as regression, time series analysis, and clustering for forecasting and trend analysis.
- Development of interactive dashboards to allow users to explore FDI data dynamically.
- Report generation summarizing key findings, trends, and recommendations.
